    * Larvae
        * Cooldown reduced (52.5-60 secs -> 30-50 secs)

    * Vulnerabilities and Resistances
        * +75% damage from players when not in the center podium. This is done to let the player deal significant damage to the Dragon when she charges him, and to be able to deal some damage with arrows since its almost impossible to hit her head while she's flying
        * -0.3% melee damage per difficulty when in the center podium
        * -50% explosion damage
    * Crystals
        * Below 15% health the Ender Dragon has a small chance each time she's hit to trigger a crystal respawning phase.

Higher difficulties mean more crystals respawned and faster respawning. This phase can only happen once per Ender Dragon
        * Maximum 4 bonus cages can now generate and maximum 5 bonus crystals instead of all crystals with cages and all towers with crystals inside.
        * Crystals no longer always spawn 16 blocks below the top of the tower, instead between 12 and 24 blocks below

          `2% chance * (Difficulty - 7)` from Difficulty = 8 to drop 4 Nether Star Shard  
          E.g. At difficulty = 10 you have 72% chance to drop 1 shard + 42% chance to drop 2 shards + 20% chance to drop 3 shards + 6% chance to drop 4 shards.

## Alpha 3.0.1
* Fixed possible freeze on Wither / Dragon load

    * New Attack Feature
        * Wither will no longer follow the player unless it's not in range (so the Wither will no longer try to stand on the head of the player ...)

## Alpha 3.0.0
* Rewritten the mod to be modular. Now requires InsaneLib

* Wither
    * Difficulty

            * If no players are found in this radius the nearest player is taken into account instead
    * Misc
        * Increased Explosion Size bonus per difficulty (0.08 -> 0.3). This means that explosion will cap at 20 difficulty (vanilla explosions don't look that good when size > 10). Also explosion is no longer replaced, instead it's just modified.

        * Wither now takes increased Magic Damage, 5% of missing health. E.g. A difficulty = 0 Wither (with 300 max health) is at 1/3 of health (so it's missing 200hp), if he were to take magic damage he will receive 200 * 5% = 10 more damage.
    * Rewards
        * Completely changed the way Nether Star Shards drop.  
          Wall of text warning:  
          `2% chance * (Difficulty - 1)` from Difficulty = 2 to drop 1 Nether Star Shard

          `8% chance * (Difficulty - 7)` from Difficulty = 8 to drop 4 Nether Star Shard  
          E.g. At difficulty = 10 you have 18% chance to drop 1 shard + 28% chance to drop 2 shards + 30% chance to drop 3 shards + 24% chance to drop 4 shards.
        * Increased Bonus Experience per difficulty (10% -> 20%)
